# Hi, I'm Vincenzo Di Sario 👋

## 📊 Data Analyst | SQL · Python · Tableau · Power BI

Data Analyst with expertise in SQL data modeling, ETL workflows, and dashboard development. I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable business insights, with a focus on customer analytics, retention patterns, and performance reporting. Based in Barcelona, I build end-to-end analytics pipelines that bridge the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making.

Additionally, I conduct financial analysis training for FAO, helping professionals strengthen their ability to interpret project KPIs and assess business-plan viability.

## 📚 Learning & Practice Projects

### 🏗️ [SQL Data Warehouse](https://github.com/Vincds/sql-data-warehouse)
**SQL Server · ETL Pipelines · Star Schema Modeling**

Built a complete data warehouse from scratch using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to understand the upstream data engineering processes that enable analytics work.

**What I Built:**
- **Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)** - Implemented full-load ETL with `BULK INSERT`, error handling (`TRY/CATCH`), and performance measurement
- **Silver Layer (Data Quality)** - Applied deduplication (`ROW_NUMBER()`), standardization (`CASE WHEN`), null handling, date enrichment (`LEAD()`), and business rule validation
- **Gold Layer (Star Schema)** - Created fact and dimension tables with surrogate keys, integrated multi-source data (ERP + CRM), built analyst-friendly views

**Why This Project:**

As a data analyst, I realized I had a critical knowledge gap: I didn't understand how data arrived in its analysis-ready state. By building this warehouse myself, I learned:
- **Data Lineage:** How to trace transformations from source to final model
- **Data Quality Patterns:** Why duplicates, nulls, and inconsistencies occur and how to fix them at the source
- **Modeling Decisions:** Why star schemas use surrogate keys and how integration rules work
- **Engineer Collaboration:** How to speak the technical language of ETL pipelines and data integration

**Key Skills:** ETL Development, Data Quality Management, Star Schema Design, Window Functions, Stored Procedures, Data Integration
